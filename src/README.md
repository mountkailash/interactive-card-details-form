### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

During this project, I had the opportunity to create an input form with confirmation functionality using React. Here's what I learned along the way:

React State Management: I gained a deeper understanding of how to use React's state to manage and update data within components. I utilized the useState hook to track the form inputs, errors, and confirmation status.

Form Validation: I learned how to implement form validation in real time by using event handlers and conditional rendering. By checking input values and applying validation logic, I was able to provide immediate feedback to the user.

Conditional Rendering: I explored conditional rendering techniques in React. I conditionally displayed different components based on the confirmation status, showing either the form or the thank you message with an accompanying icon.

Handling User Actions: I practiced handling user actions, such as button clicks, and implemented corresponding logic to handle form submission, error checking, and resetting the form state for subsequent interactions.

Styling and CSS: I utilized CSS classes to customize the appearance of the form elements, error messages, and confirmation message. I also explored how to dynamically update styles based on validation results.

This project provided me with hands-on experience in building interactive forms, implementing validation, and managing component state in React. I am excited to apply these learnings in future projects and continue exploring the vast capabilities of React.

### Continued development
I will delve deeper into React Hooks, such as useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer. By gaining a thorough understanding of these hooks, I can leverage their power to write more efficient and reusable code. I will explore advanced concepts like custom hooks, useCallback, useMemo, and more.

I will adopt a mobile-first development approach to ensure that my projects are optimized for mobile devices from the beginning. I will focus on designing and implementing responsive layouts using CSS media queries and flexbox/grid techniques. This will involve understanding and addressing common mobile design challenges like touch interactions, viewport considerations, and performance optimization.
